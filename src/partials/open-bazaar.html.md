OpenBazaar is an open source project to create a decentralized network for commerce online - using Bitcoin - that has no fees and cannot be censored. It puts the power back in the users -  hands. Instead of buyers and sellers going through a centralized service, OpenBazaar connects them directly. There are no fees, no one can censor transactions, and you only reveal the personal information that you choose.
