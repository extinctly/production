The video shows a tracking shot of aerial images of BPâ€™s Deepwater Horizon oil-spill in the Gulf of Mexico, beautifully wrapped around a sphere. The source images are from the massive oil-painting on an 80.000 square-mile canvas with over 800 million liters of oil. This piece cements the position of oil-painting as the supreme discipline of art, but at the same time gives evidence of the delicate and endangered position of painting if the discipline refuses to radically embrace technology.
