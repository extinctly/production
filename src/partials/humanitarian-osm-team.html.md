The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) applies the principles of open source and open data sharing for humanitarian response and economic development.

Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out of date, or rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS and liberating existing public sources of geographic data.

The majority of the activities of HOT occur remotely. When an event occurs the first thing that happens is a search for existing data and available satellite imagery. During this time also responding organizations are contacted to determine their needs. Someone from HOT is assigned during each response to coordinate the effort. This person makes sure everyone knows when new resources are available as well as where to focus efforts. Sometimes after this type of response work in country begins. An example of post disaster work is in Haiti, after the January 2010 earthquake there was much remote activity to gather OpenStreetMap data.
