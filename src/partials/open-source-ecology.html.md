Open Source Ecology (OSE) is a network of farmers, engineers, architects and supporters, whose main goal is the eventual manufacturing of the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS).

Focused on developing open source industrial machines that can be made for a fraction of commercial costs, with all designs shared freely online. The goal of Open Source Ecology is to create an open source economy - an efficient economy which increases innovation through open collaboration.

The current practical implementation of the GVCS is a life size LEGO set of powerful, self-replicating production tools for distributed production. The Set includes fabrication and automated machines that make other machines. Through the GVCS, OSE intends to build not individual machines - but machine construction systems, so that new machines can be built from existing machines, the GVCS is intended to be a kernel for building infrastructures of modern civilization.
