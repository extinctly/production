					<p class="text-center">Saturday 18th &amp; Sunday 19th<br>October 2014</p>

					<p>
					In a two-day event, the Serpentine, working alongside artist Gustav Metzger - who acted as co-curator and mentor to the 2014 Marathon, brought together artists, scientists, activists, designers, art historians, poets, sociologists, philosophers, filmmakers, writers, anthropologists, choreographers and musicians to address the complex and timely topic of extinction through talks, performances and screenings.

				<p><em><strong>EXTINCT.LY</strong></em> is a commissioning and research platform developed to support remote participation in the Serpentine Galleriesâ€™ 2014 <em>Extinction Marathon</em>.
				</p>
				<p> 
				Designed on the principle that ongoing engagement, collective research and collaboration are required to face and understand an uncertain future, <em><strong>EXTINCT.LY</strong></em> aims to capture the energy of the two day <em>Extinction Marathon</em> as a catalyst for sustained investigation into an inescapable and critical subject of importance to all life on earth.
				</p>
				<p>
				The <a href="http://blog.extinct.ly">Live Blog</a> and Live Stream, active during the two-day event, accompany special commissions by artists, writers, speculative designers and programmers, as well as research and data relating to the theme of Extinction. Since the event came to a close, the platform has continued to unfold and expand, with new resources added in the following months: <em><strong>EXTINCT.LY</strong></em> is focused on the continued development of artist-led projects, data visualization, and a combination of online and offline encounters.
