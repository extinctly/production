Without water, the threat to the health and safety of Detroit residents becomes immediate, the resulting negative effects of mass water shut offs begin just 2 days after shut off and can become endemic in just 60 days time.  When taking the scope into account (120,000 water accounts or 300,000+ people ) the implications become clear; this is a disaster zone and immediate relief and preparation is needed.The eight ways in which DWB is making an impact are through: drinkable water provisions; rainwater collection; cold weather gear; publishing and writing helpful information packs; advocacy and awareness; network distribution hubs; resource delivery; online DWB network.",

Ether, Ethereum's cryptofuel, powers the applications on a decentralized network. Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything, from intellectual property to smart property.  Ethereum makes use of one of the lesser known innovations by Satashi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or group of people who designed and created the original Bitcoin software. When Nakamoto set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in 2009, two radical and untested concepts were introduced. Bitcoin as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of public attention. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshis grand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Attention is starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoins technology, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money.  What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create contracts for encoding arbitrary state transition functions. Simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code, users will be allowed to create systems such as domain names, decentralized exchange, financial derivatives and on-blockchain identity and reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is smart contracts - systems which automatically move digital assets according to pre-specified rules. The logical extension of this is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) - long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and the bylaws of an entire organization.",

Among these are: a cryptographically secure ID system, blockchain based dispute resolution, marriage and divorce, land registry, education, insurance, security, diplomacy and more, through a fully distributed platform. The extra-governmental approach of BITNATION is motivated by the idea that ???Only a free and dynamic market of governance services can produce the highest quality at the lowest cost, as well as constant innovation for its customers??? (Susanna Tarkowski Tempelhof, Founder and CEO, BITNATION). <br>BITNATION is BORDERLESS: it does not care where in the world you are from, where you live, or what passport you hold. Everyone has the right to enjoy high-end, competitive governance services. BITNATION is DECENTRALIZED: it operates on the Blockchain - a cryptographically secured public ledger distributed amongst all of its millions of users around the world, to ensure peer-to-peer autonomy. BITNATION is VOLUNTARY: dedicated to the open source philosophy, and provides a platform for users to develop their own governance functions, or fork the code and create a brand new governance system. <br>Contracts made through BITNATION are not currently recognized by governments: Recognition will grow organically over time, in tandem with mainstream adoption. When Bitcoin was first invented it wasn???t recognised as a currency, until a significant amount of people started using it as a currency - the same is likely to apply in the case of BITNATION - although the recognition may be quicker since there are already a significant percentage of contracts and disputes being arbitrated by private courts around the world",

Efforts to prevent this cultural loss are severely constrained by a poor understanding of the geographical patterns and drivers of extinction risk. The authors of the paper quantifies the global distribution of language extinction risk and identifies the underlying environmental and socioeconomic drivers. <br>The research presented shows that both small range and speaker population sizes are associated with rapid declines in speaker numbers, causing 25% of existing languages to be threatened based on criteria used for species. Language range and population sizes are small in tropical and arctic regions, particularly in areas with high rainfall, high topographic heterogeneity and/or rapidly growing human populations. By contrast, recent speaker declines have mainly occurred at high latitudes and are strongly linked to high economic growth. <br>Threatened languages are numerous in the tropics, the Himalayas and northwestern North America. These results indicate that small-population languages remaining in economically developed regions are seriously threatened by continued speaker declines. However, risks of future language losses are especially high in the tropics and in the Himalayas, as these regions harbour many small-population languages and are undergoing rapid economic growth.",

The majority of the activities of HOT occur remotely. When an event occurs the first thing that happens is a search for existing data and available satellite imagery. During this time also responding organizations are contacted to determine their needs. Someone from HOT is assigned during each response to coordinate the effort. This person makes sure everyone knows when new resources are available as well as where to focus efforts. Sometimes after this type of response work in country begins. An example of post disaster work is in Haiti, after the January 2010 earthquake there was much remote activity to gather OpenStreetMap data.",

An open source, libre economy is an efficient economy which increases innovation by open collaboration. To get there, OSE is currently developing a set of open source blueprints for the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) – a set of the 50 most important machines that it takes for modern life to exist – everything from a tractor, to an oven, to a circuit maker. In the process of creating the GVCS, OSE intends to develop a modular, scalable platform for documenting and developing open source, libre hardware – including blueprints for both physical artifacts and for related open enterprises. The current practical implementation of the GVCS is a life size LEGO set of powerful, self-replicating production tools for distributed production. The Set includes fabrication and automated machines that make other machines. Through the GVCS, OSE intends to build not individual machines – but machine construction systems that can be used to build any machine whatsoever. Because new machines can be built from existing machines, the GVCS is intended to be a kernel for building infrastructures of modern civilization.",

The culmination of twelve years of research, RoboBee solved two key technical challenges of micro-robotics. Engineers invented a process inspired by pop-up books that allowed them to build on a sub-millimeter scale precisely and efficiently. To achieve flight, they created artificial muscles capable of beating the wings 120 times per second. The goal of the RoboBee project is to make a fully autonomous swarm of flying robots for applications such as search and rescue and artificial pollination. To make this feasible, researchers need to figure out how to get power supply and decision making functions, which are currently handled via a tiny tether to the robot, on board. The 3-centimeter (1.2 in) wingspan of RoboBee makes it the smallest man-made device modeled on an insect to achieve flight. Inspired by the biology of a bee and the insect???s hive behavior, Robobees researchers aim to push advances in miniature robotics and the design of compact high-energy power sources; spur innovations in ultra-low-power computing and electronic ???smart??? sensors; and refine coordination algorithms to manage multiple, independent machines.",

With a rising weather volatility and number of natural disasters, insurers and governments increasingly have problems covering big catastrophic risks. Instead they sell catastrophe bonds to spread the risk. The buyer of this bond invest his money in a catastrophe insurance and loses it all when a specified natural disaster happens within a predetermined number of years. This way the seller ensure himself against extreme losses and pays the buyer a high interest rate. Spreading risks in broader markets via cat-bonds is like distributing an earthquake of the highest level across the planet so no one will feel it. Cat-bonds deal with rare events and there’s a great uncertainty involved, yet when a natural disaster hits it hits hard.
