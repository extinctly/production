AMEG's declaration states: "Governments must get a grip on a situation which IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has ignored. A strategy of mitigation and adaptation is doomed to fail. It will be impossible to adapt to the worst consequences of global warming, as IPCC suggests. The Arctic must be cooled, ASAP, to prevent the sea ice disappearing with disastrous global consequences. Rapid warming in the Arctic, as sea ice retreats, has already disrupted the jet stream. The resulting escalation in weather extremes is causing a food crisis which must be addressed before the existing conflicts in Asia and Africa spread more widely. Dangerous global warming and ocean acidification must be prevented by reducing the level of CO2 in the atmosphere, especially by improved agricultural practice, thereby addressing the food crisis at the same time. This is an unprecedented opportunity for international collaboration for common purpose. There is no excuse for procrastination. We must see action now.</p><p>

The Detroit Water and Sewage Department is conducting mass water shut offs in Detroit Michigan which will affect over 120,000 account holders over a 3 month period at a rate of 3,000 per week. This accounts for over 40% of customers who are using the Detroit Water system and has been dubbed a violation of Human Rights by various organizations. 70,000 of those accounts are residential accounts which could amount to anywhere from 200,000-300,000 people directly affected. Without water, the threat to the health and safety of Detroit residents becomes immediate, the resulting negative effects of mass water shut offs begin just 2 days after shut off and can become endemic in just 60 days time.<br><br> When taking the scope into account (120,000 water accounts or 300,000+ people ) the implications become clear; this is a disaster zone and immediate relief and preparation is needed.The eight ways in which DWB is making an impact are through: drinkable water provisions; rainwater collection; cold weather gear; publishing and writing helpful information packs; advocacy and awareness; network distribution hubs; resource delivery; online DWB network.</p><p>

It is an open site for all matters of international development and aid, encouraging the sharing of information and collaboration with others in order to lighten our ecological footprint and live rich, sustainable lives. Guided by the use of sound principles, appropriate technology and the sharing of wisdom and project information, Appropropedia allows anyone to add, remove, or edit content on topics such as construction, energy, food/agriculture, health, medical devices, solar and transport. Often described as an "appropriate technology wiki," Appropropedia is much broader than that - stakeholders can come together to find, create and improve scalable and adaptable solutions. This can include sharing information and collaborating with others on how we can live in harmony with nature and our environment in developed countries, or discuss eg. low cost technologies for use in the developing world. In its earliest stages, Appropropedia was a collaboration between passionate people from the United States and Australia, before quickly expanding to become a global project.</p><p>

Among these are: a cryptographically secure ID system, blockchain based dispute resolution, marriage and divorce, land registry, education, insurance, security, diplomacy and more, through a fully distributed platform. The extra-governmental approach of BITNATION is motivated by the idea that "Only a free and dynamic market of governance services can produce the highest quality at the lowest cost, as well as constant innovation for its customers" (Susanna Tarkowski Tempelhof, Founder and CEO, BITNATION). BITNATION is BORDERLESS: it does not care where in the world you are from, where you live, or what passport you hold. Everyone has the right to enjoy high-end, competitive governance services. BITNATION is DECENTRALIZED: it operates on the Blockchain - a cryptographically secured public ledger distributed amongst all of its millions of users around the world, to ensure peer-to-peer autonomy. BITNATION is VOLUNTARY: dedicated to the open source philosophy, and provides a platform for users to develop their own governance functions, or fork the code and create a brand new governance system.Contracts made through BITNATION are not currently recognized by governments: Recognition will grow organically over time, in tandem with mainstream adoption. When Bitcoin was first invented it wasn't recognised as a currency, until a significant amount of people started using it as a currency - the same is likely to apply in the case of BITNATION - although the recognition may be quicker since there are already a significant percentage of contracts and disputes being arbitrated by private courts around the world</p><p>

					<p class="lead">Many of the world's languages face serious risk of extinction. Efforts to prevent this cultural loss are severely constrained by a poor understanding of the geographical patterns and drivers of extinction risk.</p><p> Many of the world's languages face serious risk of extinction. Efforts to prevent this cultural loss are severely constrained by a poor understanding of the geographical patterns and drivers of extinction risk. The authors of the paper "Global distribution and drivers of language extinction risk" quantifies the global distribution of language extinction risk and identifies the underlying environmental and socioeconomic drivers.The research presented shows that both small range and speaker population sizes are associated with rapid declines in speaker numbers, causing 25% of existing languages to be threatened based on criteria used for species. Language range and population sizes are small in tropical and arctic regions, particularly in areas with high rainfall, high topographic heterogeneity and/or rapidly growing human populations. By contrast, recent speaker declines have mainly occurred at high latitudes and are strongly linked to high economic growth. Threatened languages are numerous in the tropics, the Himalayas and northwestern North America. These results indicate that small-population languages remaining in economically developed regions are seriously threatened by continued speaker declines. However, risks of future language losses are especially high in the tropics and in the Himalayas, as these regions harbour many small-population languages and are undergoing rapid economic growth.</p><p>

Aims include expanding humanity's reach and presence beyond Earth's orbit, as well as improving our chances here on Earth by spurring the innovation needed to solve global challenges, resource constraints and the need to get along in an increasingly crowded environment.The technical approach is to support and fund Hackerspaces to function as local community hubs, carry out research and public engagement activities, conduct long term strategic foresight and planning to coordinate large scale international projects with the local hubs and lastly, to identify and expand areas of mutual relevance between terrestrial and space activities. Hackerspace activities include leadership and technical workshops for youth, while the mission of Hackerspace Global Space Program includes finding appropriate external partners, and applying principles from strategic foresight and planning for the central leadership to coordinate large scale international projects with local hubs and project partners. Hackerspaces currently doing space related projects include Noisebridge, San Francisco, which welcomes everyone to use their resources, including an electronics lab, machine shop, sewing/crafting supplies, two classrooms, a conference area, library, darkroom, and kitchen.</p><p>

It is based on a geodesic geometry adapted to construction from standard 4??8 foot sheets of factory-made construction material. It resembles a panel yurt, hence the name. The hexayurt is integral to the Networked Domestic Disaster Response project, which focuses on public coordination of disaster relief efforts.This offloads the responsibility largely from the state or government, which unites several cheap and readily available technologies to perform tasks that have been historically left to highly trained teams with expensive apparatus.The plan outlines a system of cellphone-accessible databases which would collocate raw materials, displaced people, host families and volunteer building teams to rapidly provide temporary accommodations for people made homeless by a natural disaster or man-made circumstances. The plan has been positively reviewed by the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Hexayurt building's design is in the Buckminster Fuller lineage of using contiguous triangles to maximize the load-bearing ability of simple structures. For constructions made from light material the panels can be joined by tape. For heavier builds made out of OSB or plywood, metal brackets or wooden blocks can be used. The instructions are available on Appropedia (Appropedia is used as the wiki for the hexayurt project) and are released as public domain by the inventor Vinay Gupta.</p><p>

OpenStreetMap is a project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS and liberating existing public sources of geographic data.<br><br>The majority of the activities of HOT occur remotely. When an event occurs the first thing that happens is a search for existing data and available satellite imagery. During this time also responding organizations are contacted to determine their needs. Someone from HOT is assigned during each response to coordinate the effort. This person makes sure everyone knows when new resources are available as well as where to focus efforts. Sometimes after this type of response work in country begins. An example of post disaster work is in Haiti, after the January 2010 earthquake there was much remote activity to gather OpenStreetMap data.</p><p>

Water is one of the world???s most stressed resources. Usage has shot up by more than double the rate of population increase, meaning we are guzzling more water per head than ever before. <br>Off the back of some of our preliminary research, one key component of what we are planning to do with Open Droplet is to provide context to the data collected by individual sensors. This will involve a two-way flow of data between individuals, and utilities and public bodies who are responsible for the water infrastructure. This turns Open Droplet into more than just a water sensor - it's a means of understanding how individual water flows fit within the overall water infrastructure.</p><p>

Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has said that he envisions Tesla as an independent automaker, aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer. The company also has an initiative to build free solar charging stations across the US. Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not use single-purpose, larger format cells. Tesla uses thousands of lithium-ion 18650 commodity cells. 18650 cells are small, cylindrical battery cells, which are usually found in laptops and other consumer electronics devices. Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced in a press release and conference call on June 12, 2014, that the company will allow its technology patents be used by anyone in good faith. Future agreements to be made are expected to include provisions whereby the recipients agree not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy their designs directly.Reasons expressed for this stance include attracting and motivating talented employees, as well as to accelerate the mass market advancement of electric cars for sustainable transport.</p><p>

The culmination of twelve years of research, RoboBee solved two key technical challenges of micro-robotics. Engineers invented a process inspired by pop-up books that allowed them to build on a sub-millimeter scale precisely and efficiently. To achieve flight, they created artificial muscles capable of beating the wings 120 times per second. The goal of the RoboBee project is to make a fully autonomous swarm of flying robots for applications such as search and rescue and artificial pollination. To make this feasible, researchers need to figure out how to get power supply and decision making functions, which are currently handled via a tiny tether to the robot, on board.The 3-centimeter (1.2 in) wingspan of RoboBee makes it the smallest man-made device modeled on an insect to achieve flight. Inspired by the biology of a bee and the insect's hive behavior, Robobees researchers aim to push advances in miniature robotics and the design of compact high-energy power sources; spur innovations in ultra-low-power computing and electronic "smart" sensors; and refine coordination algorithms to manage multiple, independent machines.</p><p>
