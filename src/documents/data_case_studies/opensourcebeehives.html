description_short: The Open Source Beehives project is a network of citizen scientists tracking bee decline.
description_long: The Open Source Beehives project is a network of citizen scientists tracking bee decline. It uses sensor enhanced beehives and data science to study honeybee colonies throughout the world. All of the technology and methods, from the hive and sensor kit designs to the data, are documented and made openly available for anyone to use.<br><br>The Open Source Beehives project has developed two open source beehive designs; the Colorado Top Bar and the Barcelona War. Either hive can be freely downloaded, installed to a CNC router machine, and cut from a standard 4x8 sheet of material, such as plywood. Both hives have been designed around natural beekeeping methods to lower stress factors on the colony, minimise exposure to artificial materials, and allow the bees more control over their living environment. Add in long description.<br><br>Open Source Beehives is run by Jon Minchin, Tristan Copley-Smith, Aaron Makurak, Seneca Kristjonsdottir, Garrett Burrg, Chris Borke, Patrick Beseda, Scott Piette. They welcome new collaborators to help develop the project.
