Lantern is a small, solar-charged device that continuously receives radio waves broadcast by Outernet from space (Outernet is like the radio station and Lantern is like the radio). Lantern turns the Outernet signal into digital files, such as webpages, news articles, ebooks, videos, and music. The majority of accessible content is user driven - determined by a process of suggestions and requests - while the rest is comprised of a ‘Core Archive’ of educational material and disaster updates. Additional sponsored content is always presented as such.

Lantern can receive and store any type of digital file on its internal drive. To view the content stored in Lantern, users simply turn on the Wi-Fi hotspot and connect to Lantern with any Wi-Fi enabled device. All that’s needed is a browser - Outernet is free to use and all data consumption via Outernet is anonymous.

Outernet’s long term goal is to assist the formation of communities of web users with access to a neutral resource that can educate and empower. Its primary audience is those who live in places where internet connections are liable to go down (anywhere in the world when a disaster occurs) or in places lacking the infrastructure required for a higher online population. It is the best known alternative to plans by Facebook to increase one-to-many broadcast style connectivity in Africa by means of drones, or balloons in the case of Google’s ‘Project Loon’.
