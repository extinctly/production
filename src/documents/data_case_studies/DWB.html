description_long: Detroit Water Brigade is a volunteer-led alliance of compassionate citizens of Detroit and their international allies working to bring emergency relief to families facing water shut offs while advocating for an income-based Water Affordability Plan in Detroit. The Detroit Water and Sewage Department is conducting mass water shut offs in Detroit Michigan which will affect over 120,000 account holders over a 3 month period at a rate of 3,000 per week. This accounts for over 40% of customers who are using the Detroit Water system and has been dubbed a violation of Human Rights by various organizations. 70,000 of those accounts are residential accounts which could amount to anywhere from 200,000-300,000 people directly affected. Without water, the threat to the health and safety of Detroit residents becomes immediate, the resulting negative effects of mass water shut offs begin just 2 days after shut off and can become endemic in just 60 days time.<br><br>When taking the scope into account (120,000 water accounts or 300,000+ people ) the implications become clear; this is a disaster zone and immediate relief and preparation is needed.The eight ways in which DWB is making an impact are through: drinkable water provisions; rainwater collection; cold weather gear; publishing and writing helpful information packs; advocacy and awareness; network distribution hubs; resource delivery; online DWB network.
