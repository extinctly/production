bio: Founded in 1995 by lizvlx (b. 1973, Austria) and Hans Bernhard (b. 1971, USA), UBERMORGEN is a net.art duo with a research-based practice. Open-ended investigations focus on corporate and governmental authority, institutional and individual responsibility. Sampling and sourcing materials, UBERMORGEN hack or infiltrate the net and mass media. Once in circulation, their interventions evolve; moulded and manipulated by different agents, before eventually becoming artworks.

		<p>This work of net.art is a corporate and institutional cross-projection and a brutal manifestation of Newspeak. The destruction of common meaning in language drives extinction and creates collateral damage when Data Mining industries talk and act on ‘Real-Time Anti-Fraud’ and ‘Counter-Terrorism Financing’. Real meaning disappears behind profit-seeking and every transaction is under suspicion. The never-ending tracking of people’s actions is (mis)labeled as customer service.</p>

		<p>The video shows a tracking shot of aerial images of BP’s 'Deepwater Horizon’ oil-spill in the Gulf of Mexico, beautifully wrapped around a sphere. The source images are from the massive oil-painting on an 80.000 square-mile canvas with over 800 million liters of oil. This piece cements the position of oil-painting as the supreme discipline of art, but at the same time gives evidence of the delicate and endangered position of painting if the discipline refuses to radically embrace technology.</p>
