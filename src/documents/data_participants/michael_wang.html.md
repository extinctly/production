The exhibition *Extinct in the Wild* brings together flora and fauna that are no longer found in nature, but persist exclusively in cultivation or captivity. Officially designated “extinct in the wild,” these homeless species have left nature behind to fully enter the circuits of human culture.

Each species is displayed within a life-support system tailored to the organism’s unique needs. Exhibition staff will be trained to tend these fragile living organisms. Returning curation to its ancient roots in *cura*, meaning “care,” the curator becomes a caretaker.

The exhibition transports species across national borders, and transplants nature into the space of high culture. In an age of mass extinction, these modernist techniques of displacement and collage have become strategies of survival.

*Extinct in the Wild* is currently under development as a winner of the Fondazione Prada and Qatar Museum Authority’s Curate Award.

On the <a href="http://extinct.ly/map" target="_blank">interactive map</a>, the symbol "EW" marks the last location a species was observed in the wild.
