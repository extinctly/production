title: Extinct in the Wild

bio: Michael Wang (Olney, MD, 1981) is an artist based in New York City. He uses systems operating on a global scale to explore species distribution, climate change, and the global economy. His works include “Invasives,” on the controlled release of invasive species, Carbon Copies, an exhibition linking the production of artworks to the release of greenhouse gases, and Rivals, an investment scheme designed to neutralize corporate competition.

description: The exhibition Extinct in the Wild brings together flora and fauna that are no longer found in nature, but persist exclusively in cultivation or captivity. Officially designated “extinct in the wild,” these homeless species have left nature behind to fully enter the circuits of human culture. <p>Each species is displayed within a life-support system tailored to the organism’s unique needs. Exhibition staff will be trained to tend these fragile living organisms. Returning curation to its ancient roots in <em>cura</em>, meaning “care,” the curator becomes a caretaker.<p>The exhibition transports species across national borders, and transplants nature into the space of high culture. In an age of mass extinction, these modernist techniques of displacement and collage have become strategies of survival.<p>The exhibition transports species across national borders, and transplants nature into the space of high culture.
