*Italian Limes* is a research project by Folder, departing from the idea of borders as a territorial device and complex set of norms that manifest locally. Originally commissioned by OMA and the Architecture Biennale (Venice 2014) as a part of the Monditalia exhibition, it was realised as an installation allowing its creators to unravel and shape a whole set of issues at the intersection of technology, representation and geopolitics. Developing the project as part of ***EXTINCT.LY*** allows for ongoing research into “movable borders”. The main focus will be how, because of climate change, marginal and liminal territories are becoming the pivotal centres of near-future geopolitics. Future case studies will be the Andes (the contested border on the Southern Patagonian Ice Field between Chile and Argentina); the Himalayas (on the Siachen Glacier between Pakistan and India); and the Arctic (Canada / Russia).
