title: How to be a Bioluddite

bio: Lisa Ma believes in socialising activism rather than idolising perfect futures. Creating 'Farmification' with workers of joystick factories in Shenzhen, Spa experiences at cat ladies’ homes in London and political movements with vegetarians to eat – instead of poison – invasive animals in Belgium, Lisa Ma wants to make activism iterative, innovative and reflective, like a design process. Currently she is starting a movement with the historical community of Luddites to guide our social relationship with biotechnology. Lisa Ma digs out the everyday clashes of values between what we do and what we believe in.
