title: How to be a Bioluddite

bio: Lisa Ma believes in socialising activism rather than idolising perfect futures. Creating 'Farmification' with workers of joystick factories in Shenzhen, Spa experiences at cat ladies’ homes in London and political movements with vegetarians to eat – instead of poison – invasive animals in Belgium, Lisa Ma wants to make activism iterative, innovative and reflective, like a design process. Currently she is starting a movement with the historical community of Luddites to guide our social relationship with biotechnology. Lisa Ma digs out the everyday clashes of values between what we do and what we believe in.

description: BioLudditism poses a challenge to the commonly accepted effects of bio-technologies, taking as its starting point the complex debate surrounding monocultures: GMOs, systems ecology, pandemic prevention, food deserts, sugar addiction, hormone replacement, public healthcare and the long arm of the biotech industry. <br>Following on from the NearNow panel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akfwKBdEAQc">‘Where are the Luddites: An Open Call for Bioluddites’</a> earlier this year, and the writing up of the Bioluddite Charter at the Breaking the Frame conference, Lisa Ma will use the next few months to continue her research into the contemporary resurgence of Ludditism. <br>Commencing with a series of interviews and sound recordings with participants other at this year’s <em>Extinction Marathon: Vision of the Future</em>, these will be released online over the course of the weekend. <p><a href="https://extinctly.github.io/images/participants/bioluddites_charter.pdf" target="_blank">Bioluddites Charter</a></p>
