name: Jesse Darling

title: Despite and Because of Everything

bio: Jesse Darling is an artist living in London. Their work addresses the human condition and how it is mediated through the structures, narratives and technologies that govern life as we know it, considering the social and physical body as a site where they manifest and become transformed. JD works in sculpture, installation, text and ‘dasein by design’ – where performance and unmediated experience meet. Exhibitions include Private Settings: Art After the Internet (Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw), Preteen Gallery’s It’s been four years since 2010 and Not Long Now at LIMAZULU, London, 2014. JD is represented by Arcadia_Missa.

description: A blood rite/ mourning ritual/gift ceremony for tomorrow &#38; tomorrow. JD uses a pencil and a needle in a distributed ink drawing practice that takes place between bodies in a space of mutual exchange. The custodian of each drawing makes the first sketch in words as part of a conversation process where narratives are shared and compared, and where the groundwork is laid in language for making a meaningful ritual. Finally, the image is etched in ink on the body, where it will stay - on the cellular level at least - until the death of that body and beyond. The practice is a way of manifesting networked kinship in precarious times; it is also an attempt to contain the accumulated trauma of a life through externalising scar tissue as a badge of what we have already survived. Above all it is a 'despite-everything' gesture of defiance to death (of physical bodies, community and communities), commoditisation, pointless posterity, monolithic art praxes that echo the totality of state sovereignty, and a way to embrace the inevitable, together.
